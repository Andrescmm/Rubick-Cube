## Requirements
This project also depends on 4 libraries:

* [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/)
* [GLAD](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad)
* [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm)
* [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/)

## Solver
We use the Herbert Kociemba's two-phase algorithm for solving Rubik's Cube, you can found it in this [GitHub](https://github.com/muodov/kociemba)
